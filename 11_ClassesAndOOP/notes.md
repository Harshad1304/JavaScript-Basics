# JavaScript And Classes

## OOP 

## Object 
- collection of properties and methods 
- toLowerCase() , toupperCase () , Promise() etc 

## Why use OOP 
- to avoid mess code and use chunks of code more efficiently and avoid spegitey code 

## Parts of OOP
Object Literal 

- Constructor Function 
- Prototypes 
- Classes 
- Instances (new,this)



## 4 pillars   
Abstraction :- Abstraction is like using a TV remote. You don't need to know how the remote works inside; you just press buttons to change channels or adjust the volume. Similarly, in programming, abstraction means hiding complicated details and showing only what's necessary. For instance, when you use a function like print(), you don't need to know how it's implemented; you just use it to print something.

Encapsulation :- Encapsulation is like a treasure chest. The chest keeps valuable items safe inside and has a lock to protect them. In programming, encapsulation means bundling data (like variables) and functions (like methods) together, and only allowing access through a controlled interface. For example, think of a bank account class. It keeps account balance (data) and allows you to deposit or withdraw money (functions), but you can't directly access the balance without using the provided methods.

Inheritance :- Inheritance is like a family tree. Children inherit traits or characteristics from their parents. In programming, inheritance allows a new class (child class) to use and extend the features of an existing class (parent class). For instance, if you have a class called Animal with properties like name and age, you can create a Dog class that inherits these properties from Animal and adds specific features like bark().

Polymorphism :- Polymorphism is like a person who can do different jobs based on the situation. For example, a person can be a student during the day, a worker in the afternoon, and a musician at night. Similarly, in programming, polymorphism allows objects to take different forms or behave differently in different situations. For instance, you can have a Shape class with a method called draw(), and different subclasses like Circle and Rectangle can override this method to draw themselves differently.
